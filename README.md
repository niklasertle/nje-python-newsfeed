## **Description**

This app was developed to be a news feed where users can post and comment on different articles on the website. For this porject I was responsible for creating the backend using Python and Flask. This was a new experience and the first that I had used this programming language. It is deployed to Heroku using gunicorn. The most difficult part was transferring my knowledge of NodeJS to using Python's simpler syntaxs. The app includes authentication and allows for users to signup and login to exsisting accounts.
